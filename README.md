### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

<p><p> Hi! Iâ€™m a third-year undergrad studying biostatistics and economics at the University of Virginia, pursuing medicine post-graduation. The common denominator across my interests: making healthcare work for people. Whether itâ€™s genomic sequences or financial outcomes, Iâ€™m interested in leveraging data to make care accessible and affordable.</p>

<p> Most recently, that journey brought me to the Rx analytics team at Florida Blue, developing a novel medication adherence algorithm. During the semester, I teach an introductory data science class at HackCville, a Charlottesville non-profit, and work at the Grainger Lab, studying developmental biology through bioinformatics. </p>

<p> Feel free to say hi, Iâ€™d love to chat.  </p>
